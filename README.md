## Datasets

The project contains three main datasets:

1. **DATASET1**: Contains both pre-processed (BEFORE) and post-processed (AFTER) data in CSV/Excel formats, along with their respective Jupyter notebooks for analysis.

2. **DATASET2**: Includes a CSV file with diamond data and its corresponding Jupyter notebook for analysis.

3. **DATASET3**: Contains another set of diamond data in CSV format with its analysis notebook.
